# Portfolio

This contains some projects that make up part of my portfolio. Enjoy!

## [Data Pipeline Airflow](https://github.com/JKng/Data_Pipeline_Airflow) 
*Apache Airflow | Python | SQL | PostgreSQL | Docker*

This is a personal project I've been working on. The aim was to build a simple data pipeline, extracting data from diffetent sources (API and CSV file), loading to a database (PostgreSQL), using Apache Airflow as a data orchestration workflow tool.

## [Data Analysis](https://github.com/JKng/Data-Analysis-Taxi)
*Python | SQL | Google Colab | PowerBI*

This is an online challenge I recently completed. This was a great opportunity for me to develop my skills in data analysis.
